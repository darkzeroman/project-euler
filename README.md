Project Euler in Java

My solving of the problems, only the code, sometimes I figured lots of things on paper so I don't have that available.

I've tried to give slow/fast solutions. Slow ones are usually brute forced and fast ones are optimized. At times I've done BigO analysis and trying to figure out the running time.
